📚💻 Bookstore Development - Work in Progress 💼🚧

📝 Introduction:
This project is aimed at developing an online bookstore for selling books. Please note that this is not the final version and the development is still in progress. The goal is to create a user-friendly platform where customers can easily discover and purchase their favorite books.

💡 Project Technologies:
The development of this bookstore involves the utilization of Java, JavaScript (JS), Spring framework, and HTML. The intention is to leverage the robustness and flexibility provided by these technologies to deliver an efficient and seamless user experience.

🔧 Development Status:
Currently, I am actively working on building the core functionalities of the bookstore. This includes implementing features like user registration, book catalog management, shopping cart functionality, and secure payment processing.

📚 Book Catalog:
The bookstore will offer a diverse range of books across various genres such as fiction, non-fiction, self-help, academic, and more. Users will have the ability to search for books by title, author, or genre, ensuring they can quickly find their desired reads.

🛒 Shopping Cart:
A key component of the bookstore is the shopping cart functionality. Customers will be able to add books to their cart, view the items they have selected, update quantities, and proceed to a secure checkout process.

💳 Secure Payment:
To ensure the safety of customer transactions, Spring Securety will be integrated for secure payment processing. This will include encryption techniques to protect sensitive user information during the payment process, providing peace of mind for both customers and the bookstore.

🔜 Future Plans:
In the future, the plan is to continue the development of the bookstore by incorporating additional features like user reviews and ratings, personalized recommendations, and a user-friendly admin dashboard for managing book inventory and orders.
